# Set up the API client

## Download Python and install the client

To install the Python client library, you must first install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The client supports both Python 3.x and 2.7.

Once Python is installed, run the following code in the command line to install the client library:

```shell
pip install notifications-python-client
```

## Generate an API key

[Register](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/register) for a GOV.UK Notify account and log in. If you have any issues logging in, report them at the [GOV.UK Notify support page](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support) or on the GOV.UK Notify [slack channel](https://govuk.slack.com/messages/C0AC2LX7E).

1. Log into your GOV.UK Notify account.
1. Go to API integration and click _API keys_.
1. Click _Create an API key_.
1. Type a name for the key.
1. Select either "Test - pretends to send messages" or "Team or whitelist" for _Type of key_ and click _Continue_.

Your API key will be generated. Make note of this key as you won’t be able to see it again once you leave this page.

Information on API keys can be found [here](/#api-keys).

## Get a template ID

Every notification follows a template. Templates are created by logging into your GOV.UK Notify account, clicking _Templates_ and then clicking the _Add new template_ button.

The API Notification client requires a template ID. Once the notification template has been created, you must copy the template ID from that template:

1. Log into your GOV.UK Notify account.
1. Go to _Templates_ and click on the template you need.
1. Copy the template ID.

## Set up API Notification client

You will now create a new instance of API Notification client. This client will be used for your application.

1. Add the following code to your application:

    ```python
    from notifications_python_client.notifications import NotificationsAPIClient

    notifications_client = NotificationsAPIClient(api_key)
    ```

1. Copy the API key you created into the `api_key` argument.

Once this has been installed you are ready to send a test message.

# Send a message

## Send a text message

### Method

1. Add the following method code to your application code:

    ```python
    response = notifications_client.send_sms_notification(
        phone_number='PHONE NUMBER',
        template_id='TEMPLATE ID',
        personalisation='PERSONALISATION ARGUMENTS',
        reference='REFERENCE',
        sms_sender_id='SMS SENDER ID'
    )
    ```

1. Complete the required `phone_number` and `template_id` arguments.

1. Complete the optional  `personalisation`, `reference` and `sms_sender_id` arguments if required.

1. You are now ready to send a text message notification. Run your application to send a request to API Notification client.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, you will receive the following `dict` response:

```python
{
  "id": "NOTIFICATION ID",
  "reference": "REFERENCE",
  "content": {
    "body": "MESSAGE TEXT",
    "from_number": "GOVUK"

    "id": "TEMPLATE ID",
    "version": 1,
    "uri": "https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk/v2/template/TEMPLATE-ID"
  }
}
```

If you are using the [test API key](/#test), all your messages will come back as delivered.

All successfully delivered messages will appear on your dashboard.

If the request to the client is successful, you will receive a `<generator object>` response that will return all received texts.

```python
<generator object NotificationsAPIClient.get_received_texts_iterator at 0x1026c7410>
```


## Get one page of received text messages

This will return one page of up to 250 text messages.  

### Method

Add the following method code to your application:

```python
response = client.get_received_texts(older_than)
```

You specify which texts to receive by inputting the ID of a received text message into the `older_than` argument.

Run your application to send a request to API Notification client.

### Response
